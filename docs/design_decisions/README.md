This folder contains documentations that are intended to explain some design decisions made for this project.
If you want to document a new design decision, either create a new document or folder (if you have more than one document).
The naming for both should follow the `adr_xxxx` schema, where `xxxx` is a number with 0 padding.
The number follows a sequence and increases with each new decision.
